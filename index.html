    <p>
        Hey, everyone! My name is Faraz and I am a third year student (I think, transferring schools is so hard,
        you never really know whsat semester you are in) studying Information
        Technology at Illinois Institute of Technology. I have really started to
        enjoy coding and I think my favorite language has to be Python by far.
        I am concentrating on cybersecurity and Python has a ton of tools and
        libraries for penetration testing. I also enjoy watching and playing
        soccer; my favorite soccer team is Real Madrid and my favorite soccer
        player is Cristiano Ronaldo.
