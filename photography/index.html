    <h2>Photography and Me</h2>
      <p>
        Over the last couple of years, I have dabbled into photography a lot in
        my spare time. I would take the occasional pictures of the sky and the
        flowers. Anything that I personally found beautiful or interesting. But
        I was never really that serious about it up until last year. Last year
        I finally made the decision to purchase a camera and a lens and take
        my interest to a next level. I got sucked in real quick. Everything
        about photography is just very intense for me. It has been a year since
        I got my camera and I have added some extra gear. However, photography
        has somehow become a very relaxing thing for me. I love the idea of
        preserving a memory or an instance in a frame that we can revisit
        whenever we want. I really like stopping the world with a click of a
        button and then re-presenting it back to the world. I will add some of
        my favorite artists whose work I really enjoy.
